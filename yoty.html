         <h2>BGCA’s Premier Program for Teens</h2>

         <p>Since 1947, Youth of the Year has been Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of 
         America’s premier youth recognition program, honoring extraordinary 
         young people for their achievements in leadership, service, academics, 
         and health and wellness. Each year, one exceptional Club member is 
         selected to be the National Youth of the Year. It is the most 
         prestigious honor bestowed upon a Club member.</p>

         <h2>Youth of the Year Journey</h2>

         <p>A mainstay of the Boys &amp; Girls Club Experience, Youth of the Year
         is a year-round program that helps young people develop the necessary 
         leadership tools and character traits to be successful now and 
         productive, caring, responsible adults in the future. Becoming National 
         Youth of the Year is an exciting and inspiring journey. Starting at the 
         local level, Club members of all ages are encouraged to participate in 
         the leadership program and in a rigorous application process. Local 
         judges select one teen to serve as each Club organization’s Youth of the
         Year. Each Club Youth of the Year goes on to participate in the state 
         event. Military and non-military state Youth of the Year move on to 
         regional events. Six teens, including five regional Youth of the Year 
         and the military Youth of the Year, advance to Washington, D.C., for the
         National Youth of the Year Gala and Celebration Dinner, where one 
         outstanding young person is named Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America’s 
         national teen spokesperson.</p>

         <p>When asked to talk about her experience, Jacqueline shared the
         following.  “I could not be more proud to represent this state and my 
         fellow Boys &amp; Girls Club members in the Youth of the Year program.  
         The Club has been a place where I do not have to be strong all of the 
         time.  It is a place where I can enter having an awful day and exit with
         a smile on my face.”<br> 
         Jacqueline currently attends Wellesley College.<br> <br>

         <p>When asked to talk about his Club experience, Zackary shared 
         the following.  “I started to attend the Boys &amp; Girls Club on base. 
         I made connections with the kids and most importantly the staff.  I was
         encouraged to reach my full potential and provided with opportunities 
         to flourish.  This was one of the first places I had been to that truly 
         accepted me for me.  I was not bullied, put down or treaded any 
         differently because of my differences.  The Club built up my confidence 
         and provided me with significant leadership skills.” <br> 
         Zachary currently attends Bedford High School.<br> <br>

         <h2>National Youth of the Year Role</h2>

         <p>The National Youth of the Year serves as the voice of nearly four 
         million Club youth and Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America’s teen 
         spokesperson, educating millions of Americans about the power of the 
         Club Experience, and elevating key issues facing kids and teens. The 
         National Youth of the Year’s duties can include appearing at regional 
         and national events, serving as a media spokesperson and teen thought 
         leader, and meeting with political, corporate and community leaders. 
         Continuing decades of tradi-tion, the National Youth of the Year and 
         regional finalists also meet with the President of the United States in 
         the Oval Office.</p>
