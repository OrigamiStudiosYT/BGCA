		<p>
		    Andrea began her career in 1988 working at the Boys Club in Mobile, Alabama. Having recently graduated from Boston College, she arrived in Mobile through the Jesuit Volunteer Corps and was assigned to coordinate the “Service to Girls Pilot” – a successful initiative that helped contribute to the organization’s decision to fully welcome girls into the Club. Andrea worked in various positions at the Club and after being selected as a BGCA Woodruff Fellow, she earned her MPA at the University of South Alabama. Andrea went on to work at Clubs in Southern California and Vermont, before accepting the role of founding executive director of the Boys & Girls Clubs of St. Lucie County Florida in 1994. In five years, the organization grew to include 3 neighborhood based sites and 10 school sites in the communities of Port St. Lucie and Fort Pierce. In addition to her work on the local level, Andrea supported the BGC community through her involvement on regional and national conference committees, program design workgroups and also served on the national board of The Professional Association from 1995-1999. In 1999, Andrea returned home to serve as the executive director of the West End House – an independent Boys & Girls Club in the city of Boston. In the last 19+ years, Andrea has worked in partnership with her board and team of outstanding youth development professionals to revitalize this 111 year old organization that in 1998 was slated to be dissolved. Going into her 20th year of service, Andrea is engaged in the largest fundraising challenge of her career – the Expect More Campaign which has raised $22M to date. This campaign has enabled the organization to extend services through college graduation; become the second largest, year-round employer of teens in the city, renovate and expand the facility and strengthen the capital position for a sustainable future. Andrea serves as board member of the Massachusetts Alliance of Boys & Girls Clubs and currently serves on the National advisory committee for the arts at BGCA. In addition, Andrea serves on the board of directors at the Music and Youth Initiative and also serves on the board of advisors for the Eliot School of Fine and Applied Arts.

		<h2>Priorities at the State House</h2>
		
		<p>
		    The Massachusetts Alliance of Boys & Girls Clubs is truly grateful for the ongoing support of our many champions on Beacon Hill. Each session, the policies and funding measures for which you advocate have a critical impact on the more than 175,000 young people that we serve across the Commonwealth. On behalf of the Clubs and kids in your district, we ask for your continued support for the Alliance’s 2019-2020 legislative priorities:
		</p>
		
		<h3>SUPPORT - FY2020 Budget Earmark, Youth-at-Risk line item (#4590-1507)</h3>
        
		<p>
		    <ul>
			    <li> With your help, the Alliance was able to secure a $1.7 million budget earmark for FY2019. While this allocation will provide a much-needed boost for our Clubs, this figure still represents a drastic decrease from our pre-recession funding level of $3.3 million. In recent years, we have experienced substantial increases in the number of children and families turning to us for help. </li>
				<li><b>Please support a $2.2 million earmark in the FY2020 budget.</b> </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h3>SUPPORT – Support Funding for After School Programs</h3>
        
		<p>
		    <ul>
			    <li> This was a key recommendation from the ASOST Coordinating Council’s report. State revenues from the cannabis industry are a natural fit to support after school and out of school time programs across the Commonwealth. The young people served by these programs are vulnerable to substance use, misuse, and addiction – but after school programs like the Boys & Girls Clubs have immense protective and preventative value.</li>
				<li>We support bills that direct cannabis funding to support after school, such as S.260, “An Act relative to access for after school and out-of-school time programs”, filed by Senator Brendan Crighton and referred to the Joint Committee on Education.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h3>SUPPORT - Formation of an After School and Out-of-School Time (ASOST) Legislative Caucus</h3>
        
		<p>
		    <ul>
			    <li> The publication of the After School and Out-of-School Time Coordinating Council’s report in December 2018 made clear that ASOST issues are important and deserve more focused attention and funding. We encourage the many after school champions in the Legislature to form a caucus, so that there is established forum for policy and funding-focused discussion.</li>
				<li><b>Please support the formation of an ASOST caucus – and please consider participating!</b> </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h3>SUPPORT – S.806, “An Act Creating the Home Works Program”</h3>
        
		<p>
		    <ul>
			    <li> Sponsored by Senator Joan Lovely, this bill would address the pressing need to provide support to families and children receiving emergency housing assistance. Local school systems and agencies are already overburdened and state investment is needed to ensure that these children receive quality care, academic assistance and enrichment, and recreation</li>
				<li>The Home Works program would allow these children to qualify for slots at approved after school and summer programs. Funding is directed to cost of attendance as well as, crucially, transportation. The Alliance is proud to stand in support of this bill along with the YMCAs.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h3>SUPPORT – S.312, “An Act stopping harm inflicted by the exploitation of life and development”</h3>
        
		<p>
		    <ul>
			    <li> The Boys & Girls Clubs take the safety of our young members with utmost seriousness, and we are proud to support Senator Joan Lovely’s comprehensive child sexual abuse prevention bill. We particularly applaud the bill’s rigorous approach to abuse prevention and reporting training requirements for child-serving organizations.</li>
			</ul>
