      <h2>We Are Here To Help</h2>
      <p>Boys & Girls Clubs provide comprehensive, facilities-based, youth development activities in five core programs: Character & Leadership Development, Education & Career Development, Health & Life Skills, The Arts, and Sports, Fitness & Recreation. Not just after school hangouts, the Clubs are unique youth development facilities dedicated to providing young people with the tools they need to overcome many of the obstacles that are present in their community.<br><br>Boys & Girls Clubs of America had its beginnings in 1860 with several women in Hartford, Conn. Believing that boys who roamed the streets should have a positive alternative, they organized the first Club. A cause was born. In 1906, several Boys Clubs decided to affiliate. The Federated Boys Clubs in Boston was formed with 53 member organizations – this marked the start of a nationwide Movement. In 1931, the Boys Club Federation of America became Boys Clubs of America. In 1956, Boys Clubs of America celebrated its 50th anniversary and received a U.S. Congressional Charter. To recognize the fact that girls are a part of our cause, the national organization’s name was changed to Boys & Girls Clubs of America in 1990. Accordingly, Congress amended and renewed our charter. <br><br>At the Clubs, members are involved in educational and fun youth-development programs that give each child a sense of competence, power to influence decisions, usefulness and belonging – all qualities that will help them make the most of their lives and become the leaders of today and tomorrow.<br><br>Young people think of their Club not as a building or a program but as a sanctuary: "A Place Where They Can Become." Our Clubs are one of the few places they can go in life where they feel truly welcomed, cared for, safe, accepted, and included. It is a place where they willingly receive and openly seek guidance from adults who care.</p>
