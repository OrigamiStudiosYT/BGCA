		<h2>We Are Here To Help</h2>

		<p>The Massachusetts Alliance of Boys & Girls Clubs works with state
			legislators to secure ongoing public support for our programs that
			have a critical impact on the more than 175,000 children and youth
			we serve across the Commonwealth. Please consider reaching out to
			your local representatives to ask them to increase funding and
			support for Boys & Girls Clubs in the state. Below are specific
			legislative priorities we ask you to support.
		</p>
		<a id="Legislative"></a>
		<p>Jenn Aldworth is the Executive Director of the Massachusetts
			Alliance of Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, having worked at three MA Clubs in
			Brockton, Ludlow, and Waltham. She would love to discuss the Alliance
			with you and can be reached at <a href="mailto:jaldworth@bgcb.org">jaldworth@bgcb.org</a>
		</p>
		<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

			<h1><br/><br/>PRIORITIES AT THE STATE HOUSE</h1>
		</div>

		<div id="box2">
			<p>The Massachusetts Alliance of Boys &amp; Girls Clubs is truly
				grateful for the ongoing support of our many champions on Beacon Hill.
				Each session, the policies and funding measures for which you advocate
				have a critical impact on the more than 175,000 young people that we
				serve across the Commonwealth. On behalf of the Clubs and kids in your
				district, we ask for your continued support for the Alliance’s 2019-2020
				legislative priorities: </p>

			<h3>SUPPORT - FY2020 Budget Earmark, Youth-at-Risk line item (#4590-1507)</h3>

			<ul class="listtext">
				<li>With your help, the Alliance was able to secure a $1.7
					million budget earmark for FY2019. While this allocation will provide a
					much-needed boost for our Clubs, this figure still represents a drastic
					decrease from our pre-recession funding level of $3.3 million. In
					recent years, we have experienced substantial increases in the number of
					children and families turning to us for help.</li>

				<li><b>Please support a $2.2 million earmark in the FY2020 budget.</b></li>
			</ul>

			<h3>SUPPORT – Support Funding for After School Programs</h3>

			<ul class="listtext">
				<li>This was a key recommendation from the ASOST Coordinating
					Council’s report. State revenues from the cannabis industry are a
					natural fit to support after school and out of school time programs
					across the Commonwealth. The young people served by these programs are
					vulnerable to substance use, misuse, and addiction – but after school
					programs like the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs have immense protective and
					preventative value.</li>

				<li>We support bills that direct cannabis funding to support
					after school, such as S.260, “An Act relative to access for after school
					and out-of-school time programs”, filed by Senator Brendan Crighton and
					referred to the Joint Committee on Education.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>SUPPORT - Formation of an After School and Out-of-School Time (ASOST) Legislative Caucus </h3>

			<ul class="listtext">
				<li>
					The publication of the After School and Out-of-School Time
					Coordinating Council’s report in December 2018 made clear that ASOST
					issues are important and deserve more focused attention and funding. We
					encourage the many after school champions in the Legislature to form a
					caucus, so that there is established forum for policy and
					funding-focused discussion.
				</li>

				<li><b>Please support the formation of an ASOST caucus – and please consider participating!</b></li>
			</ul>

			<h3>SUPPORT – S.806, “An Act Creating the Home Works Program”</h3>
			<ul class="listtext">
				<li>
					Sponsored by Senator Joan Lovely, this bill would address the
					pressing need to provide support to families and children receiving
					emergency housing assistance. Local school systems and agencies are
					already overburdened and state investment is needed to ensure that these
					children receive quality care, academic assistance and enrichment, and
					recreation.
				</li>

				<li>The Home Works program would allow these children to qualify
					for slots at approved after school and summer programs. Funding is
					directed to cost of attendance as well as, crucially, transportation.
					The Alliance is proud to stand in support of this bill along with the
					YMCAs.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>SUPPORT – S.312, “An Act stopping harm inflicted by the exploitation of life and development”</h3>

			<ul class="listtext">
				<li>The Boys &amp; Girls Clubs take the safety of our young
					members with utmost seriousness, and we are proud to support Senator
					Joan Lovely’s comprehensive child sexual abuse prevention bill. We
					particularly applaud the bill’s rigorous approach to abuse prevention
					and reporting training requirements for child-serving organizations.</li>
			</ul>
