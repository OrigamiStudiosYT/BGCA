			 <img src="about_files/Andrea.jfif" class="left round">
				   
			 <p>Andrea began her career in 1988 working at the Boys Club in 
			 Mobile, Alabama. Having recently graduated from Boston College, she 
			 arrived in Mobile through the Jesuit Volunteer Corps and was assigned to
			 coordinate the “Service to Girls Pilot” – a successful initiative that 
			 helped contribute to the organization’s decision to fully welcome girls 
			 into the Club.  Andrea worked in various positions at the Club and after
			 being selected as a BGCA Woodruff Fellow, she earned her MPA at the 
			 University of South Alabama.  Andrea went on to work at Clubs in 
			 Southern California and Vermont, before accepting the role of founding 
			 executive director of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of St. Lucie County 
			 Florida in 1994.  In five years, the organization grew to include 3 
			 neighborhood based sites and 10 school sites in the communities of Port 
			 St. Lucie and Fort Pierce.  In addition to her work on the local level, 
			 Andrea supported the BGC community through her involvement on regional 
			 and national conference committees, program design workgroups and also 
			 served on the national board of The Professional Association from 
			 1995-1999.  In 1999, Andrea returned home to serve as the executive 
			 director of the West End House – an independent Boys &amp; Girls Club in
			 the city of Boston. In the last 19+ years, Andrea has worked in 
			 partnership with her board and team of outstanding youth development 
			 professionals to revitalize this 111 year old organization that in 1998 
			 was slated to be dissolved.  Going into her 20th year of service, Andrea
			 is engaged in the largest fundraising challenge of her career – the 
			 Expect More Campaign which has raised $22M to date.  This campaign has 
			 enabled the organization to extend services through college graduation; 
			 become the second largest, year-round employer of teens in the city, 
			 renovate and expand the facility and strengthen the capital position for
			 a sustainable future. Andrea serves as board member of the 
			 Massachusetts Alliance of Boys &amp; Girls Clubs and currently serves on
			 the National advisory committee for the arts at BGCA.  In addition, 
			 Andrea serves on the board of directors at the Music and Youth 
			 Initiative and also serves on the board of advisors for the Eliot School
			 of Fine and Applied Arts.</p>

			<div id = "box2">
				 <p>The Massachusetts Alliance of Boys &amp; Girls Clubs is truly 
				 grateful for the ongoing support of our many champions on Beacon Hill. 
				 Each session, the policies and funding measures for which you advocate 
				 have a critical impact on the more than 175,000 young people that we 
				 serve across the Commonwealth. On behalf of the Clubs and kids in your 
				 district, we ask for your continued support for the Alliance’s 2019-2020
				 legislative priorities: </p>
				 
				 <h3>SUPPORT - FY2020 Budget Earmark, Youth-at-Risk line item (#4590-1507)</h3>
				 
				 <ul class="listtext">
					<li>With your help, the Alliance was able to secure a $1.7 
					million budget earmark for FY2019.  While this allocation will provide a
					much-needed boost for our Clubs, this figure still represents a drastic
					decrease from our pre-recession funding level of $3.3 million.  In 
					recent years, we have experienced substantial increases in the number of
					children and families turning to us for help.</li>
					 
					<li><b>Please support a $2.2 million earmark in the FY2020 budget.</b></li>
				 </ul>
				 
				 <h3>SUPPORT – Support Funding for After School Programs</h3>
				 
				 <ul class="listtext">
					<li>This was a key recommendation from the ASOST Coordinating 
					Council’s report.  State revenues from the cannabis industry are a 
					natural fit to support after school and out of school time programs 
					across the Commonwealth.  The young people served by these programs are 
					vulnerable to substance use, misuse, and addiction – but after school 
					programs like the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs have immense protective and 
					preventative value.</li>
					
					<li>We support bills that direct cannabis funding to support 
					after school, such as S.260, “An Act relative to access for after school
					and out-of-school time programs”, filed by Senator Brendan Crighton and
					referred to the Joint Committee on Education.</li>
				 </ul>
				 
				 <h3>SUPPORT - Formation of an After School and Out-of-School Time (ASOST) Legislative Caucus </h3>
				 
				 <ul class="listtext">
					<li>The publication of the After School and Out-of-School Time 
					Coordinating Council’s report in December 2018 made clear that ASOST 
					issues are important and deserve more focused attention and funding.  We
					encourage the many after school champions in the Legislature to form a 
					caucus, so that there is established forum for policy and 
					 funding-focused discussion.</li>
					 
					<li><b>Please support the formation of an ASOST caucus – and please consider participating!</b></li>
				 </ul>
				 
				 <h3>SUPPORT – S.806, “An Act Creating the Home Works Program”</h3>
				 <ul class="listtext">
					<li>Sponsored by Senator Joan Lovely, this bill would address the
					pressing need to provide support to families and children receiving 
					emergency housing assistance.  Local school systems and agencies are 
					already overburdened and state investment is needed to ensure that these
					children receive quality care, academic assistance and enrichment, and 
					recreation.</li>
					 
					<li>The Home Works program would allow these children to qualify 
					   for slots at approved after school and summer programs.  Funding is 
					   directed to cost of attendance as well as, crucially, transportation. 
					   The Alliance is proud to stand in support of this bill along with the 
					   YMCAs.</li>
				 </ul>
				   
				 <h3>SUPPORT – S.312, “An Act stopping harm inflicted by the exploitation of life and development”</h3>
				 
				 <ul class="listtext">
					<li>The Boys &amp; Girls Clubs take the safety of our young 
					members with utmost seriousness, and we are proud to support Senator 
					Joan Lovely’s comprehensive child sexual abuse prevention bill.  We 
					particularly applaud the bill’s rigorous approach to abuse prevention 
					and reporting training requirements for child-serving organizations.</li>
