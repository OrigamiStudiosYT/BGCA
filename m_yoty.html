        <p>
		    A mainstay of the Boys & Girls Club Experience, Youth of the Year is a year-round program that helps young people develop the necessary leadership tools and character traits to be successful now and productive, caring, responsible adults in the future. Becoming National Youth of the Year is an exciting and inspiring journey. Starting at the local level, Club members of all ages are encouraged to participate in the leadership program and in a rigorous application process. Local judges select one teen to serve as each Club organization’s Youth of the Year. Each Club Youth of the Year goes on to participate in the state event. Military and non-military state Youth of the Year move on to regional events. Six teens, including five regional Youth of the Year and the military Youth of the Year, advance to Washington, D.C., for the National Youth of the Year Gala and Celebration Dinner, where one outstanding young person is named Boys & Girls Clubs of America’s national teen spokesperson.
